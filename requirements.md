# Stone Mockup Generator Web Application Requirements

## Overview
Create a web application that allows users to automatically generate stone mockups similar to the ones previously created. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for inputting specifications and generating visual representations of stone pieces with proper dimensions and polished edge indicators.

## Core Requirements

### User Input Fields
1. **Dimensions**
   - Width (inches)
   - Height (inches)

2. **Polished Edges Selection**
   - Checkbox options for each edge (top, bottom, left, right)
   - Option to select multiple edges

3. **Material Properties**
   - Material type (dropdown: Quartz, Marble, Granite, etc.)
   - Thickness (dropdown: 2cm, 3cm, etc.)
   - Color/pattern (optional)

4. **Quantity**
   - Number of pieces with these specifications

### Mockup Generation Features
1. **Visual Representation**
   - Rectangular representation of stone piece with proper proportions
   - Graph paper background with 1/4" grid
   - Dimensions clearly labeled
   - Polished edges indicated with red lines and X marks

2. **Display Options**
   - Option to show/hide polished edge indicators
   - Option to show/hide grid lines
   - Option to adjust scale for very large pieces

### Export Functionality
1. **Download Options**
   - Download as PNG image
   - Download as PDF document
   - Option to include multiple pieces in a single PDF

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Ability to add multiple stone pieces to a list
   - Generate a combined document with all pieces

## Technical Requirements
1. **Responsive Design**
   - Works on desktop and mobile devices
   - Adapts to different screen sizes

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - No plugins required

3. **Performance**
   - Fast rendering of mockups
   - Efficient handling of multiple pieces

4. **Deployment**
   - Easy to deploy and maintain
   - Minimal server requirements (static hosting if possible)

## User Experience Considerations
1. **Intuitive Interface**
   - Clear labeling of input fields
   - Real-time preview of mockups when possible
   - Logical grouping of related controls

2. **Error Handling**
   - Validation of input values
   - Clear error messages
   - Default values for common scenarios

3. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Sufficient color contrast

## Implementation Approach
- Use Next.js framework for the web application
- Implement drawing functionality using HTML Canvas or SVG
- Use client-side rendering for mockup generation
- Deploy as a static website for easy hosting
